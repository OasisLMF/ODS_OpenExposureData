# UNDRR Hazard Information Profiles

UNDRR Hazard Information Profiles provide a long list of hazards and perils, grouped into several clusters.

Full documentation and hazard profiles here: https://www.undrr.org/publication/2025-update-undrr-isc-hazard-information-profiles-hips

Online reference: https://www.preventionweb.net/drr-glossary/hips

UNDRR HIPS is now the most comprehensive description taxonomy for hazards (cat and non-cat) available, and a taxonomy UNDRR are using / encouraging many to use in disaster loss databases, analytics, etc. A mapping of current OED peril codes to the June 2025 release of the HIPS is provided here for reference.

Final version of the 2025 update: https://council.science/publications/review-hazard-profiles/
Profiles themselves: https://council.science/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/HIPs-2025-07-21.pdf

The profiles also now include improved machine-readability, making them more usable in digital platforms, early warning systems, and risk assessment tools. (awaiting delivery of these)
