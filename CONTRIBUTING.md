# How to contribute to the Open Exposure Data Standard

There are a variety of ways in which you can contribute to the development 
and adoption of the OED standard.

We recommend that before contributing you:

* Review the [OED documentation](Docs/) which provides an overview of the standard and introduces key concepts and terminology.
* Review the OED specification which contains the main data components, field lists and valid values.
  * [Excel version](README.md#releases)
  * [Csv version](OpenExposureData/)  
* Review the [governance and release processes](Docs/ODS_Gov_Updates_Release_Processes_v1.1.pdf) documentation so that you are familiar with our processes for agreeing changes and releasing updates.

## Proposing changes

If you would like to propose a change to the standard then you can do this by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/OasisLMF/ODS_OpenExposureData/issues). For instance:

* if you have noticed an error in the specification or documentation.
* if you have a proposal for revising or extending the standard. 

We recommend filing an issue as the first step, so that fixes and changes can be discussed with the community.

Changes will be carried out in line with our [governance and release processes](Docs/ODS_Gov_Updates_Release_Processes_v1.1.pdf). 

Please note that any proposed changes or data contributions you make must be done so under a CC0 1.0 Universal licence.

## Promoting the standard

You can also contribute to making the standard a success by promoting it within your team, organisation or community.
