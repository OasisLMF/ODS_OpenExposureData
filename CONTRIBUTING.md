# How to contribute to the Open Exposure Data Standard

There are a variety of ways in which you can contribute to the development 
and adoption of the OED standard.

We recommend that before contributing you:

* Review the [OED documentation](Docs/) which provides an overview of the standard and introduces key concepts and terminology.
* Review the [OED specification](OpenExposureData/) which contains the main data components, field lists and valid values.
* Review the [governance and release processes](Docs/ODS_Gov_Updates_Release_Processes_v1.1.pdf) documentation so that you are familiar with our processes for agreeing changes and releasing updates.

## Proposing changes

If you would like to propose a change to the standard then you can do this by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/OasisLMF/ODS_OpenExposureData/issues). For instance:

* if you have noticed an error in the specification or documentation.
* if you have a proposal for revising or extending the standard. 

We recommend filing an issue as the first step, so that fixes and changes can be discussed with the community.

Changes will be carried out in line with our [governance and release processes](Docs/ODS_Gov_Updates_Release_Processes_v1.1.pdf). 

## Other contributions

Other contributions that can be made include, but are not limited to, third party / proprietary code lists for occupancy, construction and geography schemes, and code mappings from other schemes into OED.  

These data sets are considered to be outside of the specification but are encouraged to be contributed to this repository to support the adoption and interoperability of the standard.

Any data contributions of this sort may be suggested or contributed directly by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/OasisLMF/ODS_OpenExposureData/issues)

Once accepted, these contributions will be stored in the [Contributions](Contributions/) directory. Please note any additions or changes to this data will be made to the working branch of this repository when they are processed and are not subject to the governance and release processes of the main specification. 

Please note that any proposed changes or data contributions you make must be done so under a CC0 1.0 Universal licence.

## Promoting the standard

You can also contribute to making the standard a success by promoting it within your team, organisation or community.
