<!-- REVIEW: to merge this PR you need to choose at least 2 reviewers, such that:
 - at least one reviewer is an expert of the specific code/module/feature that is being modified.
 - at least one reviewer does a quantitative/detailed review of the changes, i.e., fully understands the changes.
 - at least one reviewer checks that the code follows the guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md (see link to the right of this page).
Note: it doesn't matter how these three aspects are split among the two reviewers, but it is important they are all fulfilled.
