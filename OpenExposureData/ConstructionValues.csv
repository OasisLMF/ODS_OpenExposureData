The operating decks are elevated 100 or more feet above the pontoons on large steel columns. Once on the desired location, this type of structure is slowly flooded until it rests on the sea floor. After the well is completed, the water is pumped out of the buoyancy tanks, and the vessel is refloated and towed to the next location. Submersibles operate in relatively shallow water, since they must rest on the seafloor.","7001 – 7099","Offshore"
